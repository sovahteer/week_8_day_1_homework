# Homework

Create a hibernate application with multiple classes

## MVP

- Create two individual classes.

Examples: A customer and order / An author and book / Guitarist and guitar / Or anything else you want.

- Persist the  the classes and create the C and R of CRUD. (`save`, `getAll`, `find(int id)`)



## Extension

- Read the documentation ( https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/4.3/javadocs/org/hibernate/Session.html
 ) to see how to do the U and D of CRUD.
- Complete the `update` and `delete` for your classes.

## Don't forget
- Don't worry about mapping any relationships between the classes or composition etc just treat them as stand-alone classes.
- Make sure you test everything in your Runner
- To create your database - `createdb`
- To reference your models in `hibernate.cfg.xml` (mapping)
